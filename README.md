# Youtube_SQL_analysis
A data analyst‚Äôs take on YouTube ‚Äî asking business-driven questions and answering them with SQL.

## üéØ Objective

üîçüíª *How much insight can be uncovered with pure SQL?*  
Turns out ‚Äî quite a lot.

This project presents a comprehensive **YouTube Analytics** case study using only **SQL** ‚Äî not relying on complex window functions or advanced features, but instead emphasizing **business-focused questions** and **clean, efficient queries**.

Though beginner-friendly, the project maintains high standards in terms of **query clarity**, **data structure design**, and **strategic analysis**.

### ‚ú® Key Business Questions Explored

- What are the top YouTube channels by subscribers, and which content categories dominate?
- Which videos have surpassed the 100K views milestone?
- What is the total yearly revenue across channel categories?
- How does MrBeast‚Äôs video performance compare across key metrics?
- Which channels maintain a NOX score above 10 ‚Äî and why is that significant?
- How do likes-to-comments and likes-to-views ratios vary across top-performing videos?
- Are there channels with below-average likes but above-average comments?

### üí° Insight-Driven Approach

The focus of this project is not merely on writing SQL queries, but on framing **questions that reflect real-world strategic decision-making** in the content creation space ‚Äî such as revenue attribution, audience engagement, and performance benchmarking.

‚úÖ **Key Insight:** Advanced SQL is not a requirement for discovering high-value insights ‚Äî understanding the **right questions** and using SQL purposefully delivers impactful outcomes.

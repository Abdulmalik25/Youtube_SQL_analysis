# Youtube_SQL_analysis
A data analyst’s take on YouTube — asking business-driven questions and answering them with SQL.


🔍💻 How much can you uncover with pure SQL? Turns out — quite a lot.

I recently completed a YouTube Analytics project using SQL — not with fancy advanced SQL functions or ranked logic, but with thoughtfully framed business questions and clean, efficient querying. 📊

While this project is beginner-friendly, I made sure to keep the standards high — focusing on clarity, structure, and value-driven insights.

✨ Here’s a peek at the kind of questions I explored:

What are the top YouTube channels by subscribers and which categories dominate?

Which videos crossed the 100K views milestone?

What’s the total yearly revenue per channel category?

How does MrBeast’s content stand out?

Which channels have NOX scores above 10 (and why does that matter)?

What’s the likes-to-comments and likes-to-views ratio across top videos?

Are there channels with lower likes but higher comments than average? 🧠

💡 My goal wasn't just to write queries — but to ask the right questions that mimic real-world YouTube strategy decisions.

✅ Key Takeaway: Even without advanced SQL functions, you can unlock powerful business insights — if you know what to ask.
